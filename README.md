# Vineeth Bhat  
A final-year Computer Science & Engineering undergrad at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/).

Things that currently pique my interest are [Software Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_system) and [Foundation Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_model).

## Contact Me
I'm always open to conversations and opportunities. I suppose I shouldn't link my GitHub back to my [webpage](https://flightvin.github.io/), so you can reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vineethbhat/) or [Email](mailto:vineeth.bhat@gmail.com).

## Projects

Makrdown's pretty great but I like webpages more. So, here's a really cool [page](https://sites.google.com/view/vineeth-bhat-projects/home) with my (cooler) projects.
