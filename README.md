# Vineeth Bhat  

Things that currently pique my interest are [Software Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_system), [Distributed Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing) and [Foundation Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_model).

## Contact Me
I'm always open to conversations and opportunities. I suppose I shouldn't link my GitHub back to my [webpage](https://flightvin.github.io/), so you can reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vineethbhat/) or [Email](mailto:vineeth.bhat@gmail.com).
